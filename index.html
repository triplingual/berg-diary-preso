		<title>Locating Mary Berg's Diary</title>

		<meta name="description" content="Summarization of the major issues in historicizing and mapping the locatable content in 'Warsaw Ghetto: A Diary by Mary Berg', written by Mary Berg (Miriam Wattenberg) between 1939 and 1944, predominantly in the Warsaw Ghetto but revised, translated, and edited afterward in New York City. Mary Berg's youth and sharp eye for the importance of place make this diary continue to be a valuable historical and affective document when studying the Holocaust, despite being out of print in English for most of the second half of the 20th century.">

						Between these two photos, Miriam spent just over two years imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto, which measured 1.3 square miles in area and was the Nazi-mandated home to somewhere from 400,000 to 450,000 people identified by the Nazis as Jews (or sufficiently Jew-like). Between the raw numbers of people and the residential stock destroyed by the German siege of Warsaw in fall of 1939, the mean number of people per residential room was 7.2. All statistics lie, and this one neglects, for instance, to tell the story of the thousands of families or individuals living (and dying) on the streets. Berg, however, kept a diary beginning on her 15th birthday and located many of the events she witnessed or heard about. ***move to next slide*** My project is to map and contextualize Berg's location-specific information.

							I add locatable references using geojson.io, with a 1930 map of Warsaw to guide me. I had to make reference also to current maps as well as to other historical maps, including (awkwardly) an unauthorized and poorly done digitization of one of the remarkable maps in Barbara Engelking-Boni and Jacek Leociak's "Warsaw Ghetto: A Guide to the Perished City".

							Mary Berg didn't live in Poland, and she didn't live in Warsaw. She lived at 41 Sienna Street, took drawing classes at 13 Leszno Street, sunbathed on the roof of 20 Chłodna Street. Likewise, she didn't live in a 4-year collapsed time. She lived by the day, by the hour — especially true when you consider that she couldn't always be sure that she would live to see the next day, or the next minute.

					<h3>To Show Both Time and Space in the Ghetto Experience</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						When this is all done, my hope is that at least some people using the site will have a greater appreciation for the day-to-day grind of the Warsaw Ghetto, for the fact that it wasn't merely a segregating experience but a terrorizing one over a long period of time.
					</p>
					<p>
						As well, I hope the essay will show Berg's work as both an important resistance effort as well as a documentation of other small, individual resistance efforts.

							The following illustrates what I think is a particularly salient example of why we need to keep working with eyewitness accounts such as Mary Berg's, even in the knowledge that it was narrativized post hoc.
